# Athena Chess Engine Coverage Report Generator
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script generates a comprehensive test coverage report with detailed
# per-file analysis and enforces 100% coverage policy.
# It performs the following operations:
#   1. Runs lcov to capture coverage data
#   2. Filters to include only project source files
#   3. Cleans unreachable code markers using AWK script
#   4. Generates HTML report
#   5. Creates detailed coverage table
#   6. Enforces 100% coverage requirement

# Reset execution counters. .gcda files accumulate across runs, and once a
# binary is rebuilt its checksum no longer matches the leftover data, so

# a different checksum") and lines that genuinely ran get reported as missed.
# Without this the result depends on whatever the previous build left behind.
