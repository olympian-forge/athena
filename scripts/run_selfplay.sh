# Production launcher for Athena training: self-play workers on every GPU
# plus train.py co-located on GPU 0, with periodic weight checkpoints.
#
# Defaults follow the measured production shakedowns (3 instances x 4
# threads per GPU at BatchTimeoutMs=4 won at ~3,300 games/hr per 4090).
# Override via environment:
#   SIMULATIONS=800 INSTANCES_PER_GPU=3 GPUS="0 1 2 3" ./scripts/run_selfplay.sh
#   SEARCH_THREADS=4         per-instance threads written into athena.cfg
#   TRAIN=0                  skip launching train.py (self-play only)
#   CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=3600 seconds between athena.pth snapshots (0 = off)

# CWD-independent, matching run.sh/test.sh/shakedown.sh: everything below
# is written relative to the repo root, not wherever this was invoked from.
