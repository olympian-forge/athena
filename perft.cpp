/*
 * Standalone perft (performance test) binary: recursively counts leaf
 * nodes at a fixed depth from a given FEN, to verify move-generation
 * correctness against known reference node counts and measure raw
 * move-generation throughput. Built separately from the main `athena`
 * UCI/search binary since it exercises only the rules core
 * (include/engine, include/chess) -- no search, NN, or UCI involved.
 * tools/perft.py drives this binary and compares its output against
 * published reference counts for standard test positions.
 *
 * Usage: perft <depth> <fen>
